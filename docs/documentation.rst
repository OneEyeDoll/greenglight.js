Hello, welcome to the Greenlight.js documentation. This is a MVC framework for Node.js, strongly inspired by the Python's Django Framework. Our main goal is to let you waste less time configuring express, and just focus on the code to write. This framework is designed to let you write complex apps in less time possible.
