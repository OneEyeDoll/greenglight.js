# greenlight.js
MVT framework for NodeJS.

This project is focused to bring a valid alternative to Django in NodeJS. This project's goals are semplicity, easy to use and scalability. Also, since we took inspiration from Django Project, we decided to name our architecture "MVT", instead of MVC, like Django does. Also, we encourage modern JavaScript, so all imports are done through ES6 syntax. We support also TypeScript, and the project was fully written with it.
