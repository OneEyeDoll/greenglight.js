# greenlight.js
MVT framework for NodeJS.

This project is focused to bring a valid alternative to Django in NodeJS. This project's goals are semplicity, easy to use and scalability. Also, since we took inspiration from Django Project, we decided to name our architecture "MVT", instead of MVC, like Django does.
